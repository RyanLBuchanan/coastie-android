# 🌊 Coastie (Android)

**Coastie** is a demonstration Android application for the **Coastal CTL AI Assistant**, designed to showcase ethical, student-first AI support for higher-education faculty.

This app mirrors the functionality and *design language* of the Coastie web experience, while using **native Android patterns (Jetpack Compose)** and an existing **Netlify + Azure AI Foundry backend**.

> ⚠️ This is a **demonstration app**, not a production release. It is intended for pilots, stakeholder demos, and UX validation.
